# Stardust UI

**:rocket: Mission:** Maintain an open standard for UI and promote its adherence and adoption.

**:busts_in_silhouette: Audience:** The broader UI community including designers, engineers, and managers.


## Why?

We identify these issues in the UI community:

- **Effort** - Engineers waste countless hours of human effort duplicating work that could be shared.
- **Support** - Accessible users are often left with subpar experiences, or are entirely unsupported.
- **Consistency** - User experience is often inconsistent and compromised between UIs due to isolated development practices.
- **Portability** - The lack of a shared language for UI limits our ability as a community to communicate, collaborate, and share.
- **Timing** - UIs have existed long enough to observe and codify a shared standard; the time is right.

Stardust UI recognizes a large opportunity for the open source community to make a meaningful difference around these issues.

## How?

### Deliverables

We intend to produce two sets of deliverables: specifications and utilities. These deliverables will be applicable to a wide range of applications, and will be designed to withstand the rapid evolution of technology.

**:scroll: Specifications** will be devoid of technological choices and implementation details.

**:wrench: Utilities** will be framework-agnostic.

### Focus Areas

Stardust UI is currently focused on providing [deliverables](#deliverables) for these areas:

- UI Component Anatomy
- Design Language
- Accessibility
- State Management
- Styling

## Supporters

We're gathering support from teams and companies who believe in open source and who have a vision for the future of UIs.  You can support Stardust UI by implementing the standards and utilities or by contributing.
